    - ❌ Add blur-view in it
    - ✅ Apply light & dark themes (see example APK: Custom Theme)
    - ✅ Add the dynamic chevron and see how its shape is getting as the height of the modal is manually changed (see example in APK: Custom Handle Example)
    - ✅ Add a backdrop when the modal is opened fully (see example APK: Backdrop)
    - ✅ Hide the navigation header when modal is minimized to '10%'
    - ✅ Return to the 'currently playing' screen if modal is collapsed to '10%'
    - ✅ Apply elevation to the modal
    - ❌ A static search box in playlist screen and a scrolling list below (see example APK: Footer)
    - ✅ Style the header title inside the modal

[Player UI]
  - Find for a good quality progress bar (may be available inside the react-native-track-player package)
  - Check how to destroy the TrackPlayer and when to (means after stopping the playback everytime or only once in the app lifecycle)

[Player Functionalities]
  - 🔥 Move the TrackPlayer to the App (otherwise navigating away from the Player component is killing the module)
  - Check why 'genre' information is not available after fetching from filesystem
  - <ADD-FEATURE> When ducking should not stop but resume


[Resolve issue: Permission denied for writing to internal storage]
    - Change the Android gradle versions (in build.gradle file) to the same as in Mobile Intrusion app project
    - Do gradle clean, uninstall the app & build the project again
